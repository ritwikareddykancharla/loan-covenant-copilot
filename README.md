## 🚨 Problem

Loan covenant monitoring is one of the **most manual, error-prone, and risk-sensitive** processes in the loan market.

Today, loan agents and lenders:

* Track covenants in spreadsheets
* Manually read long loan agreements (PDFs)
* Chase borrowers via email for compliance documents
* Miss deadlines and breaches unintentionally

This leads to:

* Hidden covenant breaches
* Operational delays
* Increased credit risk
* Regulatory and reputational exposure

Despite its importance, covenant monitoring has **not meaningfully evolved** with modern AI.

---

## 💡 Solution

**CovenantIQ** is an AI-powered desktop web application that automatically:

* Extracts covenants from loan agreements
* Tracks compliance deadlines
* Monitors borrower financials
* Detects covenant breaches early
* Generates clear, lender-ready compliance reports

All through a **single, intuitive dashboard**.

## 🧠 What is Covenant Monitoring? (Context for Judges)

A *covenant* is a promise made by a borrower to a lender in a loan agreement.
Covenant monitoring ensures these promises are continuously met throughout the life of the loan.

The **Loan Market Association (LMA)** provides standardized loan documentation and best-practice covenant language, but **monitoring remains largely manual** across the industry.
