## Slide 1: Title
-   **Headline**: CovenantIQ
-   **Sub-headline**: The Operating System for Private Credit.
-   **Visual**: Large logo + Screenshot of the Landing Page Hero section.
-   **Presenter Note**: "Private credit is a $1.7 trillion industry running on PDFs. We're changing that."

## Slide 2: The Problem
-   **Headline**: The "Ctrl+F" Crisis
-   **Bullet Points**:
    *   **Manual & Error-Prone**: Analysts spend 40% of their time manually copying data from 200-page Legal Agreements into Excel.
    *   **High Stakes**: Missing a single "EBITDA add-back" clause can trigger a technical default, costing millions in penalties.
    *   **Lagging Indicators**: Lenders often find out about risks *after* quarterly reports are filed—too late to act.
-   **Visual**: A stock photo of a stressed analyst buried in paperwork or a chaotic screenshot of a messy Excel spreadsheet.

## Slide 3: The Solution
-   **Headline**: Automated Intelligence for Lenders
-   **Core Value Prop**:
    1.  **Instant Extraction**: Drag-and-drop PDF parsing (extracts Covenants, Definitions, Thresholds).
    2.  **Live Monitoring**: Connects legal rules directly to financial data feeds.
    3.  **Predictive Alerts**: "Traffic light" system (Green/Yellow/Red) for portfolio health.

    *   **Drill-Down**: Clicking a specific loan to see the "Net Leverage Ratio" graph.
    *   **Design**: Emphasize the "Consumer-grade" UX in an Enterprise tool.
